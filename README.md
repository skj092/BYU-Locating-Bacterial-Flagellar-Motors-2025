### **Understanding the Problem Statement in Simple Terms**

You're given **3D images of bacteria**, and your task is to **detect a tiny machine inside them** called the **flagellar motor** using an algorithm.

#### **1. What is a Flagellar Motor?**
- Think of bacteria as **tiny submarines** that can swim.
- The **flagellar motor** is like a **motorized propeller** that helps them move.
- It rotates a **long tail-like structure** (flagellum), allowing bacteria to move toward food or away from danger.

#### **2. What is Cryogenic Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET)?**
- Imagine you want to see inside a **tiny object** at an **atomic level**.
- You **freeze** the object and then take **many 2D images** of it from different angles using an **electron microscope**.
- A computer then combines these images into a **3D model**, similar to how a CT scan creates 3D images of the human body.

#### **3. What is a Tomogram?**
- A **tomogram** is the final **3D image** created from Cryo-ET.
- It contains **structures inside the bacteria**, but everything looks **faint and noisy** because the imaging process has limitations.

#### **4. Why is Identifying the Flagellar Motor Hard?**
- **Noise**: The images are very blurry and full of unwanted signals.
- **Different orientations**: The motor isn’t always in the same position.
- **Crowded environment**: There are **many other structures inside the bacteria**, making it hard to pick out just the motor.

#### **5. What Do You Need to Do?**
- You need to create an **algorithm** that can look at these 3D images and **find the flagellar motor**.
- The goal is to **automate** this process, so humans don’t have to do it manually.

### **How Does This Relate to AI and Image Processing?**
- You’re essentially solving a **3D object detection problem** in noisy medical-like images.
- Techniques that might help:
  - **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – Like normal image recognition, but in 3D.
  - **Segmentation models** – To separate the motor from the background.
  - **Point cloud analysis** – Since tomograms can be treated like 3D point data.

This is a **real-world AI problem** applied to biology, similar to detecting tumors in medical scans but for bacteria.

## Given Datasets:
- train/: Directory of subdirectories each containing a stack of tomogram slices to be used for training. Each tomogram subdirectory comprises JPEGs where each JPEG is a 2D slice of a tomogram.
- train_labels.csv: Training data labels. Each row represents a unique motor location and not a unique tomogram.
```
row_id - index of the row
tomo_id - unique identifier of the tomogram. Some tomograms in the train set have multiple motors.
Motor axis 0 - the z-coordinate of the motor, i.e., which slice it is located on
Motor axis 1 - the y-coordinate of the motor
Motor axis 2 - the x-coordinate of the motor
Array shape axis 0 - z-axis length, i.e., number of slices in the tomogram
Array shape axis 1 - y-axis length, or width of each slice
Array shape axis 2 - x-axis length, or height of each slice
Voxel spacing - scaling of the tomogram; angstroms per voxel
Number of motors - Number of motors in the tomogram. Note that each row represents a motor, so tomograms with multiple motors will have several rows to locate each motor.
```
- test/: Directory with 3 directories of dummy test tomograms; the rerun test dataset contains approximately 900 tomograms. The test data only contain tomograms with one or zero motors.
- sample_submission.csv: Sample submission file in the correct format. (If you predict that no motor exists, set Motor axis 0, Motor axis 1, and Motor axis 2 to '-1')

##  Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET)¶
Cryogenic Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is an advanced imaging technique used to create high-resolution (1–4 nm) 3D models of tiny structures, such as biological molecules and cells. It works by tilting a frozen sample under a transmission electron microscope (Cryo-TEM) to capture multiple 2D images from different angles. These images are then combined to form a detailed 3D reconstruction, similar to how a CT scan works for the human body. Unlike other electron microscopy methods, cryo-ET keeps samples at extremely low temperatures (< -150°C), preserving their natural state in a thin layer of vitreous ice without dehydration or chemical damage.
